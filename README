Get To The End 2D is a 2D Game Engine

Currently, to run the game. You must install Aptana studio.
http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3

Import the project using File->Import->Existing File Into Workspace.
and select the Engine folder.

Then open Index.Html inside the editor and hit Run.

Controls:

a: Move Left
d: Move Right
space: Jump

Play through the game first before messing with 
the Level Generation tools on the lefthand side.

If using the Level Gen tools:

To place  an Object, exit, line or obsticle. Click and drag to place.

To place a particle effect simply click once.

After placing your desired level elements, hit "output level" to generate the level data for
your current level.

if making multiple changes to many levels. hit "output all levels" to generate level data for all active levels.

to add your new level data to the initial loadout of the game. Open Levels.txt and paste your code over the code
associated with the level you edited. Or paste over the entire file if output all levels was used.

if making a brand new level to have an exit connect to it you must add a line of code inside its parameters after pasting 
it onto the end of the Levels.txt

your code may look something like this:

<My New Level Title>
:playerstart 100 472
:size 720 480
:exit 614 457 629 480 2
;

change it to this

<My New Level Title>
:playerstart 100 472
:size 720 480
:index 20
:exit 614 457 629 480 2
;

the index line is how exits find your level
just add an exit to an existing level and set its connects to property to the one you picked.
you can also just change the last number in the exit property with is the index it connects to.
make sure not to use an index that has already been clamied by other levels.


The tools are very new and prone to break. Incorrect tools input may break the game,
as will drawing collision objects over the play.

Enjoy.
